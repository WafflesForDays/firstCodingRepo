# firstCodingRepo

- this repo contains four java files: name.java, hangman.java, mean.java, and methodAssignment.java

## name.java

- This program prompts the user to enter their first name and then their last name, then greets their using their name

## hangman.java

- This program has a secret word *secret* and prompts the user to enter letters
- Upon entering one of the letters correctly the letter(s) are revealed within the word
- If a letter is guessed incorrectly, the player gets a strike, displayed above the word
- 8 strikes will result in a Game Over
- If all letters are guessed correctly, the player wins and the word is fully revealed

## mean.java

- This program requests the user to enter a size for an array, followed by that many values, which it then stores in that array
- The program will then calculate the average of those numbers by adding them all together and dividing the result by the number of values enterred

## methodAssignment.java

- This program consists of various methods for use within the program
- `sum` adds three double values and outputs the result
- `remainder` calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second
- `prime` finds if the input is a prime number and outputs `true` or `false` accordingly
- `factor` takes two integer inputs and checks if the second is a factor of the first
- `factorList` provides an ArrayList of factors for a given number
- `reverse` outputs a given number written backwards
- `palindrome` checks if a word is the same forwards and backwards and outputs `true` or `false` accordingly\
- `mean` has the same function as mean.java
- `gcf` finds the greatest common demoninator of two inputs
- `bubbleSort` uses *bubble sorting* to sort a given ArrayList of integers from least to greatest
